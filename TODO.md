#FIXME: Improve !embed
        Make !embed to save the message from which it was created and what was created
        so that it is possible to modify the embedded message by editing the original
        message.
#TODO: Use foreign keys in database.
#TODO: !rules, Bot will send a message with server rules. Message can be set and modified with messages.
#TODO: Notifications based on webscraping.
